# Exercise 10: Multi Test Simulation

# Goal: Now combine all previous logic for multiple test cases, using the exact format from your challenge.
# Input:

# 2
# 3
# 1 2 3
# 4
# -1 -2 -3 -4

# Output:

# 0
# 354

#     First test case → All positive → ignore → sum = 0
#     Second → all negative → sum of each to power 4 → 1+16+81+256=3541+16+81+256=354
